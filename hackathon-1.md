# Notes
### We divided app to parts.
> Resources used:
- https://fontawesome.com/ for icons. Please create an account and get your CDN. If not i can provide mine. We just have to put that CDN script on top of our HTML head section in order to use icons.
- Instead of creating charts i used ready images. I will provide those images. You can use however your own.
- Everything else is pure HTML/CSS.
